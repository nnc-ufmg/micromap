Interface Visual module
==========================

This module contains functions that are used to display the data acquired by the RHD2000 chip.

These functions are dealing with the interface as a whole. TIn other words, they contain the front-end in which the user will be able 
to choose the acquisition parameters such as sampling frequency, filters and number of channels active during the acquisition.
